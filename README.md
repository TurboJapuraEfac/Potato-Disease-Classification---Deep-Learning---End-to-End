# Potato-Disease-Classification---Deep-Learning---End-to-End
### End to End deep learning Project. In this project we are identifying whether a potato leaf is healthy, early blight or late blight. 
### In model building we are using Tf, CNN, Data Augmentation, And as backend server Tf serving and Fast API, And for model optimization
### quantization and Tensorflow lite And For frontend & deployment React JS & GCP is used
